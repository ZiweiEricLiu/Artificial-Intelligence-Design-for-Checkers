# Artificial-Intelligence-Design-for-Checkers
A student project trying to implement an AI for playing Checkers
To run the project, simply using make command to compile the code.
Then your can run the game in two different modes:

manual mode:
./main {col} {row} {p} m {start_player (0 or 1)}

Play Against Other AIâ€™s:
python3 AI_Runner.py {col} {row} {p} l {AI_1_path} {AI_2_path}

where p = number of rows occupied by pieces in the initial state
